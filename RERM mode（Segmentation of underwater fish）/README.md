In this paper, a RFEM model (Receptive field expansion model) for underwater fish segmentation based on improving the performance of soft attention is constructed. 

Firstly, an image enhancement mechanism for underwater data is constructed based on the dark-channel image defogging algorithm, which corrects the color bias problem of underwater images with the help of a multi-step defogging algorithm and the Mixup operation to overcome the challenge of the limited dataset. 

Secondly, a strategy based on null convolution is proposed to improve the performance of soft attention, which adaptively expands the receptive field of the soft attention mechanism by combining different expansion rates to effectively capture spatial information and enhance the correlation between pixels. 

Finally, this paper designs a symmetric large convolution module Symmetric large convolution (SLConv) based on the expansion of the receptive field, which makes up for the inadequacy of the decoder in the acquisition of low-level semantic information.
